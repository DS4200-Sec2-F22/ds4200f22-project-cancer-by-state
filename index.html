    <h1>Cancer Incidence in the USA by State and Race</h1>

    <div>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Cancer affects thousands of people across the USA, and preventative screening is one of the best ways to detect and treat this disease early. This visualization was created to encourage users to get preventative screening for cancers that they may be vulnerable to based on their race and/or state of residence. This visualization can also be used by researchers that seek to understand more about cancer risk in vulnerable communities, especially related to the correlation between poverty levels, insurance levels, and cancer incidence levels.</p>

            <h3>Data</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>This tool uses data collected online from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, State Cancer Profiles, and United States Census Bureau. The data contains three files with data on the name and category of each cancer type, name of each state, race, cancer count by race, percentage of people below poverty, percentage of people insured, and the population for each state. </p>
                <p>One potential bias of the data can be inferred from the large number of "0 occurrences" of types of cancer in POC race categories. Based on the prevalence of cancer, these statistics are likely not 100% accurate, and may reflect a bias of how the data was sourced by the CDC. Another potential bias is that there are only 5 race categories, with a considerably sized "Other" category. The source could have been more specific with their demographic data collection and prevented such grouping. This data is missing the years that it represents and the links to the original sources; only the name of the organization that collected the data is included. Within the data however, there were no other data quality issues.</p>
