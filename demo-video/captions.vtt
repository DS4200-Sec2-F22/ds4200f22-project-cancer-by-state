00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.100
Hello everyone,

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.160
Welcome to our project visualizing cancer&nbsp;
incidence in the US by state and race.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.660
I'm Khushi,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.100
I'm Lesrene,

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.420
and I'm Karenna.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.900
Our tool centers around an interactive US map&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.200
displaying incidence rates&nbsp;
for the selected cancer.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.020
First, the user can choose which cancer&nbsp;
type to visualize using the dropdown menu.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.800
The default is colon and rectal cancer, and for&nbsp;
this example, we choose lung and bronchial cancer.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.680
States are colored by incidence rate, and&nbsp;
darker colors mean a higher incidence.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.500
The legend below the map shows what&nbsp;
percentages the colors correspond to,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.400
and hovering over a state will show the&nbsp;
specific rate and *total occurrences*.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.880
The user can click on a state to view the&nbsp;
racial breakdown of its cancer incidences.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.760
The pie chart on the right&nbsp;
displays this information,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.920
and the legend below shows the number&nbsp;
of cases in each racial category.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.480
Note that racial groups that were not&nbsp;
surveyed are not present in the pie chart.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.520
Below these visualizations is a scatter plot,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.300
showing percent insured versus&nbsp;
percent below the poverty line.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.700
Each circle represents a state,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.760
and the size of the circle&nbsp;
corresponds to its total population.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.560
The highlighted circle represents the&nbsp;
state that was last clicked in the map.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.460
Hovering over a circle will&nbsp;
show which state it represents,

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.420
as well as its percent insured, percent&nbsp;
below poverty, and total population.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.720
This is useful for finding&nbsp;
states with similar insurance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.240
and poverty statistics as the highlighted state.
